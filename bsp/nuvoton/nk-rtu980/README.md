# NK-RTU980
## 1. Introduction
NuMaker-RTU-NUC980, also known as Chili, is a Nuvotonâ€™s development platform that uses NUC980DR61YC microprocessor with a 64-pin package on a 50 mm x 50 mm dimension PCB. Chili board provides a high-end hardware features including a NUC980DR61YC ARM926EJ-S processor with 64 MB DRAM, 32MB SPI NOR Flash, 10/100 Ethernet MAC interface, USB 2.0 High Speed host/device connector, CAN bus, RS-485 and five GPIOs. Crypto engine supports RSA2048, AES256, ECC, SHA512 algorithm and a Pseudo Random Number Generator for communication security protection.
